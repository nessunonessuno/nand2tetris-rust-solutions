# nand2tetris Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the nand2tetris course, implemented primarily in Rust. Some older parts of the project, originally created using the web editor, have been retained despite being incomplete. (jk i deleted it, mostly were hdl files)

## About nand2tetris

nand2tetris (Also known as "The Elements of Computing Systems") is a course that guides students through building a modern computer system from the ground up. It starts with basic logic gates and progresses to a fully functional software hierarchy, including an operating system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `/assembler`: Contains the Rust implementation of the Hack assembler (Project 6)
- `/vm-translator`: Contains the Rust implementation of the VM translator (Projects 7 and 8)
- `/compiler`: [future] Placeholder for future compiler implementation (Project 10-11)
- `/os`: [future] Placeholder for Jack OS implementation (Project 12)

Each directory contains its own README with specific details about the implementation and usage. (todo)

## Implementation Details

- Primary language: Rust
- Some components may be implemented differently due to the loss of original web editor work
